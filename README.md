# MACHINE LEARNING-TELECOMUNICATION
 ML CODE FOR TELECOM IMPLEMENTATION

This project is created to predict telecomunication costumer churn. Focus in the high value costumer. The telecom companys has a lot of competition, It`s cheaper to keep a client already than to seach for others.

I used jupyter notebook in this project, all the librarys, others I have to install.
